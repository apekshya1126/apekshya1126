## Hi there 👋

# Hi, I’m Apekshya 👋

I’m a Computer Science student learning how to build things step by step.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Data Structures** and **Computer Architecture**  
- 🔭 I’m working on class projects and improving my coding fundamentals  
- 🤔 I’m still figuring out some CS concepts, but I’m getting more comfortable with them  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like learning at my own pace and organizing things once I understand them
